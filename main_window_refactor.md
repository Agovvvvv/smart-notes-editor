## UI Setup and Management
Menu/Toolbar Action Handlers: While ui_factory.py helps create menu/toolbar items, many of their corresponding action handler methods (e.g., on_summarize_note, on_new_file, on_enhance_note_triggered) reside in MainWindow. Some of these could be grouped or moved with their associated concerns.

## AI Interaction Logic:
The numerous signal handlers for AIController (e.g., _on_summarization_result, _on_text_generation_error) and methods that trigger AI operations (on_summarize_note, on_enhance_note_triggered) could be encapsulated within an AIInteractionHandler or AIViewCoordinator. This class would mediate between the UI elements in MainWindow and the AIController, and also manage UI updates based on AI task progress/results (potentially coordinating with ProgressManager and EnhancementStateManager).

## File Explorer UI Logic:
Methods related to the file explorer view (on_sidebar_file_activated, on_file_explorer_context_menu, on_refresh_file_explorer) and the UI aspects of file operations (like prompting for names in on_create_new_file_item) could be moved to a FileExplorerUIHandler. This handler would manage the QTreeView and QFileSystemModel interactions and then delegate backend file operations to FileController.

## Enhancement Workflow Management:
The EnhancementStateManager is a good step. We can ensure MainWindow strictly delegates to it and that UI components related to enhancement (like the preview dialog) are managed consistently, perhaps via the new DialogManager or the AIInteractionHandler
